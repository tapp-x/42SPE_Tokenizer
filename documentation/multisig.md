# Multisig Interaction Guide

## Overview
The Multisig contract provides an extra layer of protection by requiring a consensus of owners (2 out of 3) before any high-value transaction can be executed.

## Key Features
* **Submit Transaction**: Any owner can propose a transaction (e.g., to mint tokens).
* **Confirm Transaction**: Other owners must approve the proposal to reach the threshold.
* **Execute Transaction**: Once confirmed, any owner can trigger the final execution.

## Technical State
* `owners`: The list of authorized manager addresses.
* `requiredConfirmations`: Currently set to **2**.
* `transactions`: A log of all proposed calls and their execution status.

## How to Mint via Multisig
To perform a `mint` on the Molybdenum42 contract, the Multisig (as the owner) must be the caller:
1. **Generate Data**: Use the script in `deployment/scpits/get_encoded_function.cjs` (modified for mint) to get the ABI-encoded function call.
2. **Submit**: Call `submitTransaction` on the Multisig contract via Etherscan/BscScan.
   - `_to`: The Token Contract Address.
   - `_value`: 0.
   - `_data`: The hex string generated by your script.
3. **Confirm**: Have a second owner call `confirmTransaction` using the transaction index.
4. **Execute**: Call `executeTransaction` to finalize the minting on the blockchain.
